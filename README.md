# Coin-Flip-Streaks-Counter

This is a function that finds out how often a streak of a length defined by a user  comes up in a randomly generated sample of heads and tails. This is a general version of a practice project that appears in Sweigart's "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" (p.108).

The function takes three arguments:

1.consec: the number of consecutive Heads or Tails.
2.flipN: the number of flips in a single experiment.
3.experimentN: the number of experiments a user wants to run.
